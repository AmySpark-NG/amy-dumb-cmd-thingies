# pan con queso me gusta el pan con queso

Hi, you're checking my first repository on GitHub, a dum collection of `cmd-based-programs` written in C++, 

The `rock paper scissors` one took me like 2 months which i was takin to learn coding because i kept doing some other things but yeah it's finished, feel free to try it ig.
  
And the `signing-in-and-up` was a thing i did for learning, like generating txt files and reading from them, which even tho was painful, it was definetely worth it to open my gates to more knowledge and stuf idk

  > _oh also yeah the reason because there is no releases of any of them it's because idk how to generate an executable file without the dumb ``libstdc++-6.dll`` problem so if by chance you know how to fix this pls help me_
