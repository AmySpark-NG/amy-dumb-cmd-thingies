# pan con queso me gusta el pan con queso

Hi, you're checking my first repository on GitHub, a dummy `Rock Paper Scissors` game written in C++, took me some months because i kept doing some other things but yeah it's finished, feel free to try it ig.
  > _(yeah the reason because there is no releases it's because idk how to generate an executable file without the dumb ``libstdc++-6.dll`` problem so if by chance you know how to fix this pls help me_
